# Manjit's Dotfiles

My Dotfiles for Arch in Hyprland. I am relatively new to ricing, so while my rice is no where near perfect, it gets the job done. I am putting a lot of effort into it and am still slowly working on it. This rice is inspired by many other people's work that i find are awesome, regrettably I can't mention everyone by name.

I hope you enjoy it.

Also please note that the install script is aimed towards FRESH installs only and is still experimental so if you already have a pre existing rice set-up then back it up and please please please be careful while using the install script. Thank you!
